### Review of [The Effect of Clustering on the Emergence of Cooperation in the Spatial Prisoner's Dilemma](https://github.com/nrivkin/ComplexityNetworkProject/blob/master/reports/draft_final_report.md)

*__Question:__ What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?*

The abstract doesn't make it clear whether you replicated their experiment or disproved it under different conditions. You seem to be trying to answer whether their model holds true for a different graph-type. The explanation is not particularly clear, and the introduction makes it even more muddled. Just outright state what they did, why it interested you, and what you added on. You have the last part with the different types of graphs, but it gets lost.

*__Methodology:__ Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?*

You seem to state what they did, but not how you implemented it, or how you altered it. This is probably because you haven't finished it yet. 

*__Results:__ Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?*

The results and validation seem decent, even though they don't have a specific reason for the different results. It would be nice to have a couple of guesses in that place. The figures have axes labels, but no captions or titles, and some show legends for lines I can't see. Because of this, I really don't understand what's going on in their figures.

*__Interpretation:__ Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?*

They start to interpret, but I feel like there could be more. I have a hard time visualizing what they are saying. It might be helped if they state how the experiment they are replicating defined defectors and cooperators, and what causes them to switch.

*__Replication:__ Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did they compare? If not, why not?* 

No, but they were similar on some level. No visual that I noticed to show the connection. They were not sure why theirs was different, but stated as much.

*__Extension:__ Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?*

Extension is hinted at in the abstract, but not currently written up.

*__Progress:__ Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?*

The replication seems mostly complete, and it sounds as though they have gotten results from the extension, but not yet written it up.

*__Presentation:__ Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?*

Your sections have boring names. Either name them something helpful or just don't include the section breaks at all. You can write it in a fashion that covers all the points without explicitly saying 'this is what we're doing now' and it'll be fine. Also, make sure you are always in present tense. You keep switching. "Masuda and Aihara *suggest* that their work may *suggest*" is an awful line, sorry. 'suggest' is also just used too much in the abstract.

*__Mechanics:__ Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?*

It is in the proper directory and named correctly. The title is accurate and descriptive. A few formatting issues, but overall it is fine.
