## Draft Review

Lucy Wilcox

##### Question: What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

My understanding is that your team is testing the spatial prisoner's dilemma with preferential attachment. I don't know why you're doing this, maybe this will be added when you add more on the expansion.

You note this, but explain the prisoner's dilemma. Also what are square lattice graphs with rewiring? Is this four degrees? 

##### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

I don't understand what T is, without knowing what T is I don't think I can understand what you did. It seems that it somehow defines a transition region which you are using to verify your model. You should also mention what p is when you first introduce it and explain what b is.

##### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

What is %C in your graph? Is it % cooperators? What is time? Is it steps? Explaining what you mean by cooperators, defectors, and their relationship to b and p would be helpful. It's also unclear how a node would change from a defector to cooperator and vice versa in the model. 

##### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

I'm unsure of how you are interpreting your replication of their model, I can't tell what is part of their experiment and what might be an extension. I think it's all replication, but then you talk about the experiment, thought it's not clear what the experiment is for so I assume it's replication. Also why would defectors and cooperators converge? Why wouldn't they?

##### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper? 

You do a pretty good analysis of differences between your model and the authors.

##### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

N/A 

##### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

Still some work to do on that extension!

##### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

Try to proofread the final report! There are a lot of typos.

Typos: 
- "under preferentially attachment"
- "But In the game theory"
- "So there was many attempts"
- "They set the number of node, n is 3600 and each node has the 8 neighbors in all graph by keeping the degree of each node constant when they rewire graphs."
- "Unlike Masuda and Aihara observed that cooperators dominate defector in the first condition, the proportions of cooperators converge to small values in many graphs."
- "So there was many attempts to resolve the dilemma"
- "Unlike Masuda and Aihara observed that cooperators"
- "The proportion of cooperators after transient increases when"
- "The graphs have about half value after transient" <-- I'm not sure what you mean by transient in these
- "We draw the proportion of cooperator over time graph to check the tendency of the network over time"

Write in present tense, I didn't bother adding these to the typo list, but if you read through you will find a lot of places you use past tense.

You shouldn't call out each section separately in your paper.

##### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

Formatting is okay right now. I suggest you caption your figures and you could probably put two on each line.
