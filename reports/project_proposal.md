#Epidemic Spread through Trade Routes in Medieval Europe

## Lucy Wilcox and Kaitlyn Keil

**Abstract** We intend to replicate the spread of the Black Plague as modeled by Jose M. Gomez and Miguel Verdu by considering the connections--both trade- and pilgrimage-based--of cities in the medieval ages. We will examine the way cities are initially and then re-infected based on their centrality and local transitivity. Once this first pass is done, we will introduce other factors, such as cities reacting to the plague and increasing measures against infection.

We plan to study the paper *Network theory may explain the vulnerability of medieval human settlements to the Black Death pandemic* by Gomez and  Verdu. They create an explanatory model of the networks between cities involved in the black plague to analyze which factors were correlated with the damaged caused. Interestingly, the data that they used for defining connection between cities more closely fitted an exponential distribution than a power law distribution. 

In particular, they analyzed the centrality and local transitivity in the trade and pilgrimage networks. This could be simulated by layering two networks: one to represent trade routes and one to represent pilgrimage paths. Using this graph with data about the transitivity of the plague and city populations, we can simulate the spread and mortality rate of the Black Plague. Following what Gomez and Verdu did, we can calculate the infection intensity of the Plague for a range of transmission rates with respect to the graph’s degree, closeness, and clustering coefficient. We will replicate these findings with our model.

After looking at the initial spread in an entirely susceptible network, we can extend the project by including dynamic immunization to represent cities reactions to the plague (quarantines, less dense population, etc). Based on the way the plague spreads with these addition factors and which cities get infected multiple times or have the highest mortality rate, we can make connections between the centrality, local transitivity, and possibly population in order to determine what factors were particularly deadly in the spread of this disease.

This model, as it currently stands, is purely simulatory. It models an event long past with decently documented results, which brings a risk of attempting to mimic the effects without having a clear reason for why certain parameters exist. This also increases the risk that our extensions will fall under the category of “bells and whistles” rather than meaningful additions. We can attempt to combat this by making ties to current events or generalizing our results to situations other than the Black Plague. One tie and addition we could make deals with concerns of antibiotic resistance and new strains of diseases. We could introduce the probability that a new strain of the plague is formed which negates any “resistance” a city has built up to the disease. We can see how this additional factor impacts the disease intensity in different graphs. 

To analyze our results we can visualize them like Gomez and Verdu did and look at how degree, closeness, and clustering coefficient are impacted by different measures cities might take or mutations the disease undergoes. 


Our model could act as a predictive model and suggest the impact measures would have on the outcome of the spread of a disease. An example might be that if 20% of cities are effectively quarantined/immunized the total mortality rate for the whole graph might drop by x%. Of course it could not be claimed that these predictions would map to current measures that could be taken today, but they could provide reason to investigate certain strategies.

To begin, we will construct the graphs with connections for pilgrimage and trade. From there we will write a function to calculate the chance of a given city becoming infected, based on the connected cities and rules of infection. We plan to finish replicating their model within the first week and then move on to adding additional factors. Initially we plan on working together and pair programming the re-implementation of their model so we each understand the entirety of it well. This should better allow us to add additional factors to the model.

Gomez and Verdu create an explanatory model of the networks between cities involved in the black plague to analyze which factors were correlated with the damaged caused. Particularly they analyzed the centrality and local transitivity in the trade and pilgrimage networks. They propose that there is a relation between the severity of the plague and these factors and suggest researching if this pattern holds in the present day.

In their article, Onaga, Gleeson, and Masuda examine how epidemics (both in physical and viral information space) spread over dynamic, or temporal, networks. They construct these networks through graphs of certain connectivity which discard their edges after a certain time period before being activated and reconnected. Each node has a certain activity potential to represent an individual's tendency to make connections. Through a simulation that combines this model and continuous-time susceptible-infected-susceptible modeling, they predict the pattern of epidemic spread and show that high nodal concurrency enhances epidemics. This model could be extended to examine the effects of two mutually exclusive epidemics with either similar or different connectivity.
