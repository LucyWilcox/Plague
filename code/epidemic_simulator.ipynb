    "This notebook runs a simulation that replicates the work of Gomez and Verduâ€™s [*Network theory may explain the vulnerability of medieval human settlements to the Black Death pandemic*](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep43467). It creates a World class that is populated by cities and routes (both trade and pilgrimage) from data found at the [Old World Trade Routes Project](http://www.ciolek.com/owtrad.html). This World class is then saved via pickling for ease of access.\n",
